# Fall Faster
An arcade style game on PC for two players on a single keyboard, best two out of three rounds.

## Description
Two characters must race each other to the bottom of the screen in order to win that round.
Utilized: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code. 

## Bugs
Some bugs I plan to fix in the future:
1) The holes that the characters fall through are sometimes inaccurate.

## Future Plans of Implementations
1) Implement a start button for the game.
