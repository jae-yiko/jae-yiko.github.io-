My first module 1 game project called Fall Faster.
Fall Faster: Game developed by utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all from VSC2. 
Designed as a two player game with maximum three rounds before the winner is determined.
Currently, an incompleted game due to some bugs.

Feel free to check it out!
